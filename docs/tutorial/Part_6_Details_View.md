#Deliteful Tutorial (Part 6) - Adding a Details View

In the [previous step](Part_5_Custom_Renderer.md) of the deliteful tutorial we enhanced the display of our photo list
view.
We will now add a second view that shows the details of a photo.

##Markup and CSS

As we have seen [previously](ListView.md) or main view is made of a toplevel `d-view-stack` component which, so far,
contains only one view (the list view). The new details view will be added to this view stack,
so it can replace completely the list view:

````
<!-- page content -->
<d-view-stack class="width100 height100" id="vs">
	<d-linear-layout id="listView">
	    ...
 	</d-linear-layout>
    <!-- details view -->
    <d-linear-layout id="detailsView">
        <!-- page content header -->
        <d-linear-layout vertical="false" class="pageHeader">
            <div>
                <button is="d-button">Back</button>
            </div>
            <div class="fill titleStyle">Photo Details</div>
        </d-linear-layout>
        <!-- page content -->
        <div id="photoDetails" class="fill"></div>
    </d-linear-layout>
</d-view-stack>
````

The details view contains a header (implemented using a `d-linear-layout`, we are familiar with this already),
and a simple `div` that will contain the photo details.

Let's also add a little rule in `css/app.css` to set a margin on the details div and allow vertical scrolling on it:

````
#photoDetails {
    margin: 9px;
    overflow-y: auto;
}
````

##JavaScript

Add this code to `js/app.js`:

````
	photolist.on("click", function (event) {
		var renderer = photolist.getEnclosingRenderer(event.target);
		if (renderer && renderer.item) {
			document.getElementById("photoDetails").innerHTML =
				renderer.item.description.replace(/href=/ig, "target=\"_blank\" href=");
			vs.show(detailsView);
		}
	});
````

This code adds a `click` event handler to the list. The handler first finds which item was clicked (using the
`getEnclosingRenderer` method of the list) and accesses its data `item` (that is, the JavaScript object returned by
the Flickr query and that describes the photo). The item contains a `description` property that is an HTML fragment,
so it is really easy to populate the details view by setting the `innerHTML` property of the `photoDetails` div to
this description. We only change it slightly so that the anchors contained in the description open a separate window
instead of replacing our page.

Then, the important call is `vs.show(detailsView)`. The `vs` variable is our `d-view-stack` widget,
and it has a `show` function that makes one of its children visible. By default, the new view will be shown using a
slide transition, so that's OK for us.

We also want to be able to go back from the details view to the list view, and we added a Back button in the header
for this. let's just add an event handler in the markup to do this:

````
    <button is="d-button" onclick="vs.show(listView, {reverse:true})">Back</button>
````

You can try that new feature and click on an item to see the details view:

##Next Step

In the next step we will complete our small app by customizing the side pane to implement a
[settings view](Part_7_Settings_View.md).
