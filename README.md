# dui

This project provides a UI Widget framework and a predefined set of components working both on desktop and mobile platforms.

One goal of the project is to
[converge the dijit and dojox/mobile widgets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_kgrX25ylxuhtZCRrqAoABMaSdgxjAQgpyd0Ap4xvZU/edit#)
into a single set of components.

Another is to
[build on emerging web standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqe3Oq7W6lg-JY_iqMl5G7SxGTD0uQ6FFIoP4KPAkUw/edit#heading=h.ct7kwnepj0cc).
